# Minesweeper AI Bots

This started off as a project for a Deep Learning class, but now I am expanding upon what I created for the project.

I have created a few bots that can play Minesweeper.

So far, the bots include a small, basic rule-based bot and two simple CNN-based bots. I will add more descriptions of these bots later on.

I will expand upon this project using a UNet to segment the board into safe and unsafe cells. After learning about UNets from a friend, it clicked that it might be a good solution for segmenting a minesweeper board into "safe" and "unsafe" tiles for a bot to click.
